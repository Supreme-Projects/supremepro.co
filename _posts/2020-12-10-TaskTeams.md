TaskTeams is a project-based tracking SaaS currently in development. Administrators can customise dashboards to suit the nature of their users groups. Functional inputs can also be set at admin level, allowing for ease of workflow control. Projects can be monitored in an easy to view grid, with the option to populate client credentials which are held in a CMS. 

We have all used many different systems in our working lives, most of which are an ‘off the shelf’ product that works quite well but is always missing just a few points that would make it perfect. With myTeams, this issue is resolved! The fully customisable dashboard means you can tailor this product to your business needs. As your business changes and evolves, myTeams can change with you, ensuring no time-consuming workarounds or less efficient ways of recording data. Our aim is to help streamline your systems so you can focus on the importance of your customers, and your business.
